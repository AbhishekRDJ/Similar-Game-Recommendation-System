# Similar Game Recommendation System

This repository contains a machine learning-based application for recommending similar games. Built with Python, the project uses the Random Forest algorithm for training and Streamlit for an interactive frontend interface.



# Similar-Game-Recommendation-System
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system designed to suggest similar games based on user input. It employs Python and the Random Forest algorithm to train a model on a dataset, which is then saved in a .pkl file for efficient use. The frontend is developed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface
