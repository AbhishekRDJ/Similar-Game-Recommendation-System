# Similar-Game-Recommendation-System
This project is a machine learning-based recommendation system designed to suggest similar games based on user input. It employs Python and the Random Forest algorithm to train a model on a dataset, which is then saved in a .pkl file for efficient use. The frontend is developed using Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface

## **Features**
- **Game Recommendation:** Suggests games similar to the one input by the user.
- **Machine Learning:** Trains the model using the Random Forest algorithm.
- **Streamlit Frontend:** Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- **PKL Integration:** Saves the trained model in a `.pkl` file for efficient usage.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Scikit-learn**  
- **Streamlit**
